;;; Commentary:

;; This package advises the `nameframe-make-frame' function to
;; switch to a eyebrowse after creating a frame.

;; To use this library, put this file in your Emacs load path,
;; and call (nameframe-eyebrowse-mode t).

;;; Code:

(require 'nameframe)
(require 'eyebrowse)

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode nameframe-eyebrowse-mode
  "Global minor mode that switches eyebrowse when creating frames.
With `nameframe-eyebrowse-mode' enabled, creating frames with
`nameframe-make-frame' will automatically switch to a eyebrowse
with that frame's name."
  :init-value nil
  :lighter nil
  :global t
  :group 'nameframe
  :require 'nameframe-eyebrowse
  (cond
   (nameframe-eyebrowse-mode
    (add-hook 'nameframe-make-frame-hook #'nameframe-eyebrowse--make-frame-switch-hook))
   (t
    (remove-hook 'nameframe-make-frame-hook #'nameframe-eyebrowse--make-frame-switch-hook))))

(defun nameframe-eyebrowse--make-frame-switch-hook (frame)
  "Used as a hook function to switch eyebrowse based on FRAME's name."
  (nameframe-switch-frame (nameframe--get-frame-name frame))
  (progn
    (eyebrowse-init)
    (eyebrowse-switch-to-window-config-1)
    (eyebrowse-rename-window-config (eyebrowse--get 'current-slot) (nameframe--get-frame-name frame))
    ))

(provide 'nameframe-eyebrowse)
