* Nameframe

Nameframe provides utility functions to manage frames by their names.

It's primary goal is to be used with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] and/or [[https://github.com/seudut/perspeen][perspeen.el]]. When opening a Projectile
project, it will either switch to an existing frame of the project, or
create a new frame for the project.

** Installation

*** MELPA

Nameframe is now available on [[http://melpa.org/#/?q=nameframe][MELPA]]. The Projectile and perspeen.el integrations
are distributed separately (and thus will need to be installed separately).

- ~M-x package-install~ =RET= ~nameframe~ =RET=
- ~M-x package-install~ =RET= ~nameframe-projectile~ =RET=
- ~M-x package-install~ =RET= ~nameframe-perspeen~ =RET=

*** Manual install

Copy ~nameframe.el~ into your Emacs load path.

Optionally, copy ~nameframe-projectile.el~ and ~nameframe-perspeen.el~
into your load path as well. See *Usage* section below for details.

** Usage

*** Vanilla

| symbol                   | description                                                      |
|--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~nameframe-switch-frame~ | (interactive) function to switch between existing frames by name |
| ~nameframe-create-frame~ | (interactive) function to create a new frame                     |

*** Projectile

Nameframe provides Projectile integration to open projects in their
own frames. To enable Projectile integration, add the following line to your
init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(nameframe-projectile-mode t)
#+END_SRC

With Projectile integration enabled, a hook is added to create/switch to a project's frame when switching projects.

*** Perspeen

Nameframe also provides ~perspeen.el~ integration, so each frame has its own
workspace (and thus have its own list of buffers).

To enable perspeen integration, add the following line to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(nameframe-perspeen-mode t)
#+END_SRC

With perspeen integration enabled, calling ~nameframe-create-frame~ will now
create a workspace.

*** Recommended setup

Although the Projectile and ~perspeen.el~ integrations are optional, nameframe
really shines when used in conjunction with both packages. Here is a snippet on how to
use nameframe to its full potential:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Assuming Projectile and perspeen.el are already installed

(projectile-global-mode)
(persp-mode)

(nameframe-projectile-mode t)
(nameframe-perspeen-mode t)

;; If your OS can't switch between applications windows by default *cough* OS X *cough*
;; you can have a shortcut to switch between existing frames by name
(global-set-key (kbd "M-P") 'nameframe-switch-frame)

#+END_SRC

With this setup, switching to a project will open it in its own dedicated
frame with isolated buffers.

** Caveats

- Only (thoroughly) tested on GUI Emacs 24.5 on OS X
  - but seems to work fine on terminal Emacs
- Does not work with Helm (I personally don't use Helm. Pull-requests welcome.)
